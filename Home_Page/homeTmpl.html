When he turned 21, his aunt threw him out of the house and told him he needed to find some work and take care of himself and he was shown pity by Grant Kendall. Taking a job as a hired hand, and moving into the guest house on the Kendall's ranch, Manny set his sights on their daughter Alice when she had barely turned 18.
